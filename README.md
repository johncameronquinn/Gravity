Android client repository for the former company, Gravity. Designed & Developed by John Cameron Quinn. quinnjc@g.cofc.edu

Note that some of the feature and UX decisions were made inconjunction with other members of the company.

As for the state of this repository - very unfinished. I was a massive project, intended to be built and maintained by only one person for the forseeable future. When I was working on this client I was also managing the company as a whole, and as a result I had to cut corners to find the time. This meant that many coding conventions, comments, documentation etc. were neglected, because after all, I was the only one working on it. 

Also, there is an incongruent nature in the code, because my skill as a developer evolved so massively throughout development. To say it shortly, its probably pretty bad code. I remember when I learned why people used interfaces, and realized how much of my code I probably needed to rewrite. But, I was so frequently rewriting things, I figured it'd be best to just leave it for now. I had had no education on Software Architecture, Software Engineering, etc. I just had a few Java classes. I never even knew anything about Android at first, but I just jumped into it. I think, along that line of reasoning, it shows what I believe this repository demonstrates the best. I took initiative, and set about doing something that was incredibly difficult. I was running face first into a mountain of ignorance, and I when I realized that, I just started climbing. I did this with no mentorship or formal education - just what I found on the internet.

If the business side of Gravity was set in stone before we started development, as it should have been, I believe this project would be in a much more finished state. However, we experienced feature creep, scope creep, constant shifts in marketing design- all kinds of things. The dunning-kruger effect definitely applied with our collective business knowledge. We thought what they did was easy - it was not. Towards the end, I started to finally get a really solid hand on project management, except I realized that solving Gravity's problems at the business level would require all of my time, and I had to cease development on the client. I realized to develop a client this massive whilst also performing all of my other duties was not realistic, even with my insane work ethic at the time. I was searching for an Android Developer to bring onto the project and assist me in development, when the project terminated.

But, we live and learn, and I definitely learned.
